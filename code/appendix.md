# Software
The processes conducted here use open source software only. We rely heavily on the programming language R [@base]. Aside from its large community of data analysts developing packages for data wrangling, R supports an impressive array of tools specifically for GIS. In this section, we introduce the software we found most helpful for georeferencing.

## Packages
+ [@stringdist]
+ [@sp], [@maptools], [@rgeos], [@rgdal]
+ [@raster]
+ [@spatstat]
+ [@foreach]
+ [@doMC]

## QGIS
+ [@qgis]
